## Soup

* 1 onion
* 1 carrot
* 1 tomato
* 1 celery stalk
* 1 garlic bulb
* frozen peas
* white wine or vinegar
* handfull cabbage or kale
* olive oil

## Bread

* 1 pound all-purpose flour (about 3 cups) plus more for sprinkling
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast
* 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water
* shredded cheese
* herbs

REST: That’s it. You don’t have to touch a thing. Just cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap, or a towel, and let it rest for 12-18 hours at room temperature. Overnight is ideal.

BAKE: When it’s baking time, preheat the oven to 450. Stick a 6 quart Dutch Oven (or similar) in the oven for about 30 minutes to preheat. At this point, the dough should be big and puffy and pretty loose, with little bubbles in it. Gently scrape the dough out onto a well-floured surface. (Remember: NO KNEAD.) Gently shape it into a ball with flour on the outside, set on a piece of parchment, and wait for your pan to heat up.

BAKE: Lift the dough and parchment together into the pan. Bake, covered with a tight fitting lid, for 30 minutes. Remove the cover and bake another 10-15 minutes to get the exterior nice and golden brown and crispy. Now start breaking chunks off, admiring the cheesiness, spreading with butter and salt, and dunking in all your best soups. THIS IS LIVING!
